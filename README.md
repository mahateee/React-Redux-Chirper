# Chirper Project

This repo is a code-along with the first project in the React Nanodegree program.

## Project overview

The project we'll be building is called “Chirper”. Building this simple Twitter clone will help you practice improving the predictability of an application's state; establishing strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and identifying what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.
